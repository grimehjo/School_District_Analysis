# School_District_Analysis

Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this module was to analyse school district data - specifically grades and student performance in most instances. The specific task in the challenge was to use the 'loc' function in pandas/jupyter notebook to find out how much the data indicators change when you take out 9th graders/freshmen from the overall highschool data.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

Surprisingly, nothing changed too dramatically when one takes the 9th graders out of the data for Thomas High School. Atleast from what I was able to see.

I had a bit of a challenge getting used to the loc function for the 2nd part of the deliverable so I was only able to complete half of the second deliverable- and because of that, my analysis here might be a bit lucklaster. One thing I was pleased about is how close my data from the module matched the challenge starting data- meaning I was able to follow along well through Module 4 without making too many mistakes.
